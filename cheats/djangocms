# Apphook theme integration

This is maybe not the best way to do this but it's work.

First doc is here : http://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/introduction/05-apphooks.html

(`.` is the root of the django-cms project)
(`myApp` is the django app to be ingreted to django-cms)

Create another django app specialy for integrate the wanted django app.
(ex: `./myApp_cms_integration/`)

For apply the theme you need, in the cms app create a folder, to create a
`templates` folder for the integrated django app.
(ex: `./myApp_cms_integration/templates/myApp/`)

Copy the base.html template of myApp django app and modify the file with this
code:

```
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block apps %}
# Here come all the code from the base.html of myApp (In this example)
{% endblock %}
```

You also need to add somewhere in the template of the django-cms project
`{% block apps %}{% endblock %}`.
